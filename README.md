## What is this?

A single API that aggregates anime episode lists and streaming links from multiple providers. Give it an AniList ID, get back everything — episodes, sources, and stream URLs — all in one place.

It's the backbone powering **[Anivexa](https://github.com/walterwhite-69/Anivexa)**, a full anime streaming client built on top of this.

## Notice!
***This API intentionally uses AniList as its catalog and identity layer. When AniList is unavailable, the API may be partially unavailable or unstable as well. If you do not want an AniList-backed catalog, this simply is not the API for your use case!. So dont bother using it.***

## Providers

| Provider | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **MKissa** | ✅ Active | Large Library, Note: it may still return 403 error, their backend is one of the trickiest, it works fine but sometimes return "Need Captcha" Error. It might be slow since it will retry if it gets captcha error while requesting|
| **Reanime** | ✅ Active | Solid source for a wide range of titles |
| **AniKoto** | ✅ Active | Good library, consistent |
| **AnimeGG** | ✅ Active | Fuzzy title matching + compact-query fix for sequels (e.g. Re:Zero S4) |
| **AniNeko** | ✅ Active | Reliable slug-based matching |
| **AniDB App** | ✅ Active | Language-aware, AniDB ID backed |
| **AniZone** | ✅ Active | HLS + subtitles, sub-only; year-based re-scoring prevents wrong-season matches |
| **AniWaves** | ✅ Active | Direct HLS from Vidplay, MyCloud, and BYFMS; DATASV quality MP4 sources; embed fallbacks |
| **Anibd** | ✅ Active | Uses Anilist ID internally; AniList ID used everywhere else |
| **Kickassanime** | ✅ Active | Fuzzy search, medium library |
| **AnimeDunya** | ✅ Active | HLS + subtitles, sub-only, MAL ID backed |
| **AnimeOnsen** | ✅ Active | DASH + subtitles, sub-only, AniList/MAL identity verified |

## Routes

```
GET /map/:anilistId
```
Returns cross-platform ID mappings — MAL, TVDB, TMDB, Kitsu, AniDB, and more.

```
GET /episodes/:anilistId
GET /episodes/:provider[/:provider...]/:anilistId
```
Returns episode lists in a single response with smart background refresh. Pass one or more provider names in the path to filter results — e.g. `/episodes/anizone/mkissa/16498` returns only those two. Omit providers to get all of them.

```
GET /watch/:provider/:anilistId/sub|dub/:provider-:ep
```
Returns stream URLs for a specific episode from a specific provider.

```
GET /stream/reanime/:id/sub|dub/:ep
```
302 redirect directly to the HLS stream.

## ReAnime / FlixCloud playback notes

<details>
<summary>Click to see playback/decryption guide</summary>

ReAnime uses FlixCloud for some streams. The returned `url` can be a signed HLS master URL, but FlixCloud may return the manifest as a Base64 + XOR payload instead of plaintext `#EXTM3U`.

For those streams, use the returned `playlist_key` or `key` field to decode the master playlist and any child playlists before handing them to an HLS player.

```js
function decryptFlixManifest(bodyBuffer, playlistKey) {
  const raw = Buffer.isBuffer(bodyBuffer) ? bodyBuffer : Buffer.from(bodyBuffer);
  const trimmed = raw.toString("utf8").trim();

  if (trimmed.startsWith("#EXTM3U")) return trimmed;

  const key = Buffer.from(playlistKey, "base64");
  let payload = Buffer.from(trimmed, "base64");
  const out = Buffer.alloc(payload.length);

  for (let i = 0; i < payload.length; i++) {
    out[i] = payload[i] ^ key[i % key.length];
  }

  const text = out.toString("utf8").trim();
  if (!text.startsWith("#EXTM3U")) throw new Error("FlixCloud manifest decrypt failed");
  return text;
}

function getManifestUrls(m3u8Text) {
  return m3u8Text
    .split(/\r?\n/)
    .map((line) => line.trim())
    .filter((line) => line && !line.startsWith("#"));
}

async function fetchAndDecryptFlixManifest(manifestUrl, playlistKey) {
  const res = await fetch(manifestUrl, {
    headers: {
      "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
      "Referer": "https://flixcloud.cc/",
      "Origin": "https://flixcloud.cc"
    }
  });

  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`manifest HTTP ${res.status}`);

  const body = Buffer.from(await res.arrayBuffer());
  return decryptFlixManifest(body, playlistKey);
}
```

`HD-1` commonly uses AES-keyed HLS playlists. `HD-2` commonly uses image-wrapped `.png`/`.webp` segment URLs, so a custom proxy/player may need to unwrap those segment bytes before playback.

For HD-2 style image-wrapped segments, fetch the segment through your proxy, unwrap it, and return it as `video/mp2t`.

```js
const flixImageSegmentXorKey = Uint8Array.from([
  157, 42, 241, 71, 179, 142, 92, 112,
  166, 25, 228, 59, 216, 98, 15, 197
]);

function unwrapFlixImageSegment(bodyBuffer) {
  const body = Buffer.isBuffer(bodyBuffer) ? bodyBuffer : Buffer.from(bodyBuffer);
  let offset = 0;
  let needsXor = false;

  const isWebp =
    body.length > 12 &&
    body[0] === 0x52 &&
    body[1] === 0x49 &&
    body[2] === 0x46 &&
    body[3] === 0x46 &&
    body[8] === 0x57 &&
    body[9] === 0x45 &&
    body[10] === 0x42 &&
    body[11] === 0x50;

  const isPng =
    body.length > 8 &&
    body[0] === 0x89 &&
    body[1] === 0x50 &&
    body[2] === 0x4e &&
    body[3] === 0x47 &&
    body[4] === 0x0d &&
    body[5] === 0x0a &&
    body[6] === 0x1a &&
    body[7] === 0x0a;

  if (isWebp) {
    offset = 12;
    needsXor = body[offset] !== 0x47;
  } else if (isPng) {
    offset = 8;
    needsXor = body[offset] !== 0x47;
  }

  if (!offset) return { body, unwrapped: false };

  const out = Buffer.from(body.subarray(offset));
  if (needsXor) {
    for (let i = 0; i < out.length; i++) {
      out[i] ^= flixImageSegmentXorKey[i % flixImageSegmentXorKey.length];
    }
  }

  return { body: out, unwrapped: true };
}
```

The API does not expose a public ReAnime `/proxy` route. If you need direct custom-player playback, use the returned `embed` URL or implement the manifest decode/proxy flow above.

***Removed the ReAnime `/proxy` endpoint since it was unnecessary and did not handle the Flixcloud playback flow anyway.***

## Self-hosted

```bash
git clone https://github.com/walterwhite-69/Anivexa-API
cd Anivexa-API
npm install
cp .env.example .env
node server.js
```

Runs on Node.js. No build step needed.

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CACHE_ENABLED` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable caching (memory + disk + Redis). |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | — | From [upstash.com](https://upstash.com). Only used when `CACHE_ENABLED=true`. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | — | From [upstash.com](https://upstash.com). Only used when `CACHE_ENABLED=true`. |
| `DEFAULT_REDIS_TTL` | `900` | Seconds. Fallback expiry for Redis writes when a per-item TTL isn't computed. Most cache entries use their own smart TTLs based on anime status (finished/airing/etc.) — this is just the safety-net default. |
| `PORT` | `4000` | Local dev server port (`server.js` only — ignored on Vercel/serverless). Change it if `4000` is already in use, then hit `http://localhost:PORT`. |
| `MKISSA_WREQ_BROWSER` | `chrome_149` | wreq-js browser TLS and HTTP/2 profile used for MKissa requests. |
| `MKISSA_WREQ_OS` | `windows` | Operating-system profile paired with the MKissa browser profile. |
| `MKISSA_WREQ_REQUIRED` | `false` | Set to `1` to return a wreq-js error instead of falling back to Node fetch when its native binding is unavailable. |

On Vercel (or Railway/Render), set these as regular project environment variables instead of committing `.env`.

## Deploying on Vercel

> ⚠️ **Not recommended.** Vercel runs on shared datacenter IPs that are widely blocked by anime streaming sites. Most providers will fail silently or return errors — the API will technically run but you'll get little to no data back. Use a self-hosted VPS or use railway, render etc etc. The proxy file is for anidb app not for streams!
